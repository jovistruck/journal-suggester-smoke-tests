    title: "Mechanical Stimulation-Induced Cross-Adaptation in Plants: An Overview"
    body: "Mechanical stimulation (MS), existing widely but ignored usually in nature, is one of the environmental stress factors. MS not only affects growth, development, morphogenesis, and even survival of plants, but also induces the formation of cross-adaptation. In cross-adaptation, plants make use of common pathways and components to adapt to a range of different stresses after exposure to one specific stress. Here, we summarize current knowledge of MS-induced cross-adaptation to chilling, heat, salt, drought, and pathogen stress, as well as its possible mechanisms. Plants, due to sessile nature, are constantly exposed to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Abiotic stresses, including extreme temperature, drought, high salinity, heavy metal, and mechanical stimulation (MS), are major causes of crop failure worldwide. MS, namely mechanical stress, such as wind, raining, hailing, touching, gravity, grazing, loading, and soil obstruction, existing widely but ignored usually in nature, is one of the abiotic factors affecting growth, development, morphogenesis, and even survival of plants (Jaffe and Biro 1979; Knight 2000; Braam 2005; Fig. 1). Plants have developed sensory mechanisms to detect mechanical stimulation and to induce a suite of responses such as anatomical, physiological, biochemical, biophysical, and molecular collectively termed “thigmomorphogenesis” (Jaffe and Biro 1979; Knight 2000; Braam 2005). The study on MS may have been traced back to The Power of Movement in Plants by Charles Darwin (1880), but advances in MS is very slow due to its diversity, complexity, uncertainty, and it is hard to quantify. With the development of molecular biology technique and imaging technique, understanding MS has made great progresses in recent years. https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs12374-011-9178-3/MediaObjects/12374_2011_9178_Fig1_HTML.gif Fig. 1 Types of mechanical stimulation in plants. Plants subject simultaneously and sequentially to various overground and underground mechanical stimulations in nature (adapted in part from Buchanan et al. 2000) For excellent additional information, we refer readers to wonderful reviews written more recently (Braam 2005; Chehab et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010). Here, we summarize current knowledge of MS-induced cross-adaptation to chilling, heat, salt, drought, and pathogen stress, as well as its possible mechanisms. MS-Induced Cross-Adaptation Cross-adaptation, namely cross-tolerance, is the phenomenon by which a plant resistance to a stress leads to resistance to another form of stress. For example, cold acclimation can increase heat tolerance of winter rye, ultraviolet radiation can enhance heat tolerance in cucumber and cold hardiness in Rhododendron, and salt pretreatment can induce cold hardiness rapidly in spinach and potato (Knight 2000). Our previous experiments results showed that heat shock can improve resistance of maize seedlings to heat, chilling, salt, and drought (Gong et al. 2001). We and other authors have found that mechanical stress can induce cross-adaptation in plants as summarized as follows (Table 1)."

    title: "Dectin-2-dependent host defense in mice infected with serotype 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae"
    body: "Background Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major causative bacterial pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia, possesses a thick polysaccharide capsule. Host defense against this bacterium is mediated by activation of innate immune cells that sense bacterial components. Recently, C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) have garnered much attention in elucidating the recognition mechanism of pathogen-derived polysaccharides.Methods In the present study, we first compared the clinical course and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of Dectin-2 knock-out (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. Mice were infected intratracheally with a serotype 3 strain of S. pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae bacterial engulfment by neutrophils and inflammatory cytokine and anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific IgG levels were evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We also examined the effect of Dectin-2 deficiency on interleukin (IL)-12 production by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) stimulated with the bacterial components. Results S. pneumonia-infected Dectin-2KO mice had a shorter survival time, larger bacterial burden and lower interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production in the lungs than WT mice. Although neutrophilic infiltration in the lungs was equivalent between Dectin-2KO mice and WT mice, S. pneumonia engulfment by neutrophils was attenuated in Dectin-2KO mice compared to WT mice. The anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific IgG and IgG3 levels in BALF were lower in Dectin-2KO mice than in WT mice. When BM-DCs were stimulated with S. pneumoniae culture supernatant or its Concanavalin A (ConA)-bound fraction, IL-12 production was abrogated in Dectin-2KO mice compared to WT mice. Conclusions We demonstrated that Dectin-2 is intimately involved in the host defense against infection with a serotype 3 strain of S. pneumoniae. Dectin-2-dependent IL-12 production may contribute to IFN-γ synthesis and subsequent production of serotype-specific anti-capsular polysaccharide IgG after S. pneumoniae infection, which may promote S. pneumoniae bacterial opsonization for engulfment."

    title: "Gene expression profiling of the venomgland from the Venezuelan mapanare (Bothrops colombiensis) using expressed sequence tags (ESTs)"
    body: "Results We constructed a cDNA library from the venom gland of B. colombiensis, and a set of 729 high quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was identified. A total number of 344 ESTs (47.2 % of total ESTs) was related to toxins. The most abundant toxin transcripts were metalloproteinases (37.5 %), phospholipases A2s (PLA2, 29.7 %), and serine proteinases (11.9 %). Minor toxin transcripts were linked to waprins (5.5 %), C-type lectins (4.1 %), ATPases (2.9 %), cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP, 2.3 %), snake venom vascular endothelium growth factors (svVEGF, 2.3 %), L-amino acid oxidases (2 %), and other putative toxins (1.7 %). While 160 ESTs (22 % of total ESTs) coded for translation proteins, regulatory proteins, ribosomal proteins, elongation factors, release factors, metabolic proteins, and immune response proteins. Other proteins detected in the transcriptome (87 ESTs, 11.9 % of total ESTs) were undescribed proteins with unknown functions. The remaining 138 (18.9 %) cDNAs had no match with known GenBank accessions. Conclusion This study represents the analysis of transcript expressions and provides a physical resource of unique genes for further study of gene function and the development of novel molecules for medical applications Major toxins Metalloproteinases The highest number of toxin ESTs in B. colombiensis were metalloproteinases (37.5 %). This abundance of metalloproteinases has been already observed for other Bothrops transcriptomes. The percentages for these reported metalloporteinases range, approximately, between 25–80 % and the highest reported was for B. alternatus (urutu) representing 81.4 % of the toxins transcripts [24]. Other Bothrops with a high expression of metalloproteinase genes were B. atrox (61.6 %) [25] and B. jararaca (29.9–53.1 %) [26, 27] (Fig. 2; Additional file 3). Metalloproteinases are crucial components in hemostasis as well as in thrombosis [28]. Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are responsible for the hemorrhagic condition, which is one of the most severe consequences of Viperidae snake envenomations. SVMPs are classified into three subclasses established on their domain structure [29, 30]. These SVMP groups are: The P-I class (20–30 kDa) comprises a single metalloproteinase domain. The P-II class (30–60 kDa) involves a metalloproteinase domain and a disintegrin domain. The P-III class (60-100 kDa) comprises a metalloproteinase, disintegrin-like and cysteine-rich domains [31]. The former P-IV class, a P-III structure which includes an additional C-type lectin-like domain was re-classified into a P-IIId subclass. When a blood vessel is damaged by SVMPs, these circulating enzymes adhere and accumulate on the disrupted surface of the subendothelium and activate platelets. The aggregation and adhesion of these cells to the subendothelium are facilitated through the interaction of extracellular matrix proteins with their agonist receptors, namely integrins, on the platelet membrane [32, 33]. This intraluminal cell adhesion may initiate the athero-thrombotic process leading to intravascular thrombosis [34–36]. On the other hand, snake venom hemorrhagic metalloproteinases can also digest several blood coagulation components, counting fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, which amplify the hemorrhagic activity [20, 37]. As described above, the disintegrin domain is part of snake venom metalloproteinases, and mostly derived by proteolytic processing of the protein precursor to produce a free disintegrin [38–40]. Disintegrins are low molecular weight proteins ranging from 49–84 amino acids in length that are known to be involved in cell adhesion ligand recognition, binding specifically to integrin receptors on the cell surface and also exhibiting anti-platelet aggregation activity. Because of their low molecular weight and ability to block integrin activity, both native and recombinant disintegrins have been widely investigated for their anti-cancer activities in biological systems in vitro and in vivo [41–48]. In the current work, we identified 129 putative metalloproteinases, which were grouped into five contigs and five singletons (Fig. 1, Tables 1, 2). These 10 unique SVMP clusters corresponding to partial cDNA sequences were named BC01–BC10. The B. colombiensis transcriptome contained transcripts for P-I (83.3 % of the total SVMP ESTs and 31.4 % of total toxin transcripts, clusters BC01 and BC02), P-II (2.3 % of the total SVMP ESTs and 0.9 % of total toxin transcripts, BC03 and BC04), and P-III (14 % of the total SVMP ESTs and 5.2 % of total toxin transcripts, BC05–BC10). The BC01 cluster showed the most abundant metalloproteinase cluster (83 % of the total SVMP ESTs and 31.1 % of total toxin transcripts). It posesses a 20-residue signal sequence, a conserved M12B propeptide region, and a reprolysin domain with a zinc-binding motif (HEXXHGXXH motif). NCBI BLAST analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of the partial PI-SVMP cluster BC01 had 87.7 % sequences identity with metalloproteinase BaP1 (P-I class) [P83512.2] from B. asper, atrolysin-c [Q90392.1] from C. atrox with 76.3 % identity, and was 74.8 % identical to AclVMP-I [Q92031.1] from Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus and AplVMPI [B7U492.1] from A. piscivorus leucostoma (Fig. 3). In addition, BC02 (0.3 % of total toxins) were homologous to a non-hemorrhagic MP-II (BjussuMP-II) from B. jararacussu venom gland. According to Marcussi et al. [49], BjussuMP-II isolated from B. jararacussu snake venom belongs to class P-I devoid of hemorrhagic activity, but exhibit proteolytic activity on some components of the extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen, collagen, and gelatin. Additionally, several non-hemorrhagic P-I SVMPs with fibrino(geno)lytic activity have been reported in Bothrops species such as colombienase-1 and colombienase-2 from B. colombiensis [2], BJ-PI2 from B. jararaca [50], and neuwiedase from B. neuwiedi [51]."

    title: "What is normal? Next generation sequencing-driven analysis of the human circulating miRNAOme"
    body: "Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-protein-coding RNA species that have a regulatory function in modulating protein translation and degradation of specific mRNAs. MicroRNAs are estimated to target approximately 60 % of all human mRNAs and are associated with the regulation of all physiological processes. Similar to many messenger RNAs (mRNA), miRNAs exhibit marked tissue specificity, and appear to be dysregulated in response to specific pathological conditions. Perhaps, one of the most significant findings is that miRNAs are detectable in various biological fluids and are stable during routine clinical processing, paving the way for their use as novel biomarkers. Despite an increasing number of publications reporting individual miRNAs or miRNA signatures to be diagnostic of disease or indicative of response to therapy, there is still a paucity of baseline data necessary for their validation. To this end, we utilised state of the art sequencing technologies to determine the global expression of all circulating miRNAs within the plasma of 18 disease-free human subjects. Results In excess of 500 miRNAs were detected in our study population with expression levels across several orders of magnitude. Ten highly expressed miRNAs accounted for 90 % of the total reads that mapped showing that despite the range of miRNAs present, the total miRNA load of the plasma was predominated by just these few species (50 % of which are blood cell associated). Ranges of expression were determined for all miRNA detected (>500) and a set of highly stable miRNAs identified. Finally, the effects of gender, smoking status and body mass index on miRNA expression were determined.Conclusions The data contained within will be of particular use to researchers performing miRNA-based biomarker screening in plasma and allow shortlisting of candidates a priori to expedite discovery or reduce costs as required.Normalised miRNA expression values were used to compare the expression of individual miRNAs between plasma samples (Additional file 1: S1). In the first instance, we investigated which miRNAs were most abundantly expressed in human plasma. Based upon the mean expression of 18 independent samples, microRNAs 486-5p, 10b-5p, 320a, 423-5p, 92a-3p, 22-3p, 10a-5p, 181a-5p, 151a-3p, and let-7f-5p were found to be most abundantly expressed in the plasma of our study participants. Surprisingly, the most abundant miRNA (miR-486-5p) accounted for almost 60 % of the total number of sequencing reads mapping to miRNAs and furthermore, the ten most abundant miRNAs accounted for approximately 90 % of mapped reads. To verify these striking findings, we reviewed the results of thirty-seven publically available plasma miRNA-seq datasets obtained via miRmine online (Guan Laboratory, University of Michigan—Additional file 1: S1, sheet 2) and undertook a complete re-analysis (from raw sequencing data) of three randomly selected plasma sequencing runs from the short read archive [accession numbers; SRR1005875, SRR1005877 and SRR1005876]. The top ten miRNAs accounted for 68 and 74 % of the total mapped read count in the reviewed and re-analysed datasets respectively. The fraction of the total plasma miRNA read count attributed to each of the top 10 most highly expressed miRNAs is detailed in Fig. 3 (left-hand axis). The normalised expression (reads per million; RPM expressed in Log 2 scale) of each of these miRNAs in human whole blood, serum and plasma (using publically available data via miRmine) is included on the right-hand axis. Comparison of plasma data from this study and those derived from miRMine revealed no clear correlation, however, significant variation within the later dataset may explain this finding (Fig. 3, right-hand axis error bars). https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12867-016-0057-9/MediaObjects/12867_2016_57_Fig3_HTML.gif Fig. 3 Fraction of the total sequencing reads mapped occupied by each of the ten most highly expressed miRNAs (based upon the mean of 18 samples) are presented (grey bars) ± S.E.M. The mean expression in human plasma, serum and whole blood derived from 116 publically available datasets is included on the right hand axis for comparison (reads per million—RPM ± S.E.M, in Log2 form). Note for clarity, errors bars are only included for the plasma datasets Next we sought to determine the origin of these highly expressed miRNAs. As per the available literature, five out of the ten most highly expressed miRNAs were previously identified as being highly expressed by cells of the blood. MicroRNAs 486-5p and 92a-3p were shown to be highly expressed by erythrocytes, whilst miRNAs 181a-3p, 151a-3p and let-7f-5p were highly expressed by various blood cell types [11, 15]. To ensure our highly expressed miRNAs were naturally present at such levels, as opposed to the result of haemolysis, we determined the expression variation in both blood cell and non-blood cell associated miRNAs with the expectation that these should be equivalent in the absence of haemolysis. Variation in our blood cell associated miRNAs was in fact less than that of the non-blood cell associated miRNAs (Coefficient of variation = 95.8 vs 116.3 %, N = 18), supporting our findings. Leveraging over 300 publically available next generation sequencing datasets (including 66, 13 and 37 in human blood, serum and plasma respectively), we were able to determine the tissue expression profile of each highly expressed miRNA. Whilst each miRNA exhibited a different tissue based expression pattern, nine of the ten (miRNA-151-3p was the exception) highly expressed miRNAs identified herein had median expression levels in either blood, serum or plasma in excess of the median expression for all tissues, suggesting that the blood is a significant source of these. Furthermore, in considering only those miRNA-seq datasets generated from human plasma, nine of the ten (miR-10b-5p was the exception) top expressed miRNAs identified in this study appeared within the upper quartile of expression, confirming that our results mirror those of other studies conducted using similar methods in the same biological sample type. Comprehensive tissue expression data for the most highly expressed miRNAs identified in human plasma is included within Fig. 4. https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12867-016-0057-9/MediaObjects/12867_2016_57_Fig4_HTML.gif Fig. 4 Tissue based expression data for the ten most highly expressed miRNAs detected in human plasma. Data are reads per million (RPM) in Log 2 form obtained from miRMine online (Guan Laboratory, University of Michigan). Box and whisker plots identify the minimum and maximum, upper and lower quartile and median values Our realisation that a number of the most highly expressed miRNAs were of blood cell origin led us to consider the potential implications that this may have for biomarker development (for a comprehensive review of the challenges associated with miRNA biomarker development, please refer to [16]. The routine clinical sampling of blood involves venapuncture, delivery to a suitable storage vessel with or without anticoagulant and delivery to the analytical laboratory. The preparation of plasma or serum involves a further step during which blood cells are removed by centrifugation to leave a “cell free” supernatant. At each point, there is potential to influence the number of blood cell associated miRNAs present in the remaining sample either through haemolysis following venapuncture or during transportation, or via variation in the time and or intensity of centrifugation. In support of this, Pritchard and colleagues have previously demonstrated significant increases in erythrocyte-associated miRNAs (miRs-451, 16, 92a, 486) in haemolysis, and explained miR-150 and 223 expression as a function of lymphocyte and neutrophil count respectively [15]. Thus, small variations in blood sample preparation may lead to individual samples being enriched or depleted in certain blood cell types and thus have significant impacts upon the expression of specific miRNAs. Of concern is the fact that all of the blood cell associated miRNAs identified herein have been identified in biomarker screens and or proposed as novel biomarkers for various conditions (miR-486-5p—gastric adenocarcinoma, miR-92a-3p—colorectal cancer, miR-181-5p—endometrial carcinoma, miR-151a-3p—paracetamol toxicity, let-7f-5p—Alzheimer’s disease) and may thus be subject to the aforementioned issues. In order to determine the normal range of circulating miRNA expression within our disease free population, the mean and the standard error of the normalised expression values was calculated and the miRNAs ranked according to their apparent stability. The most stably expressed miRNAs included microRNAs 486-5p, 25-3p, 10b-5p, 99b-5p, let-7f-5p, 10a-5p, 423-3p, 101-3p, 532-5p, and 103a-3p (Fig. 5). Although several of the most abundantly expressed miRNAs were identified, these highly stable miRNAs represented several orders of expression magnitude including both highly abundant and very lowly expressed miRNAs. Wang et al. [18] have previously reported the stability of a restricted set of plasma and serum miRNAs and despite differences in experimental design and measurement techniques, various miRNAs were identified as highly stable in both studies (Table 4)."

    title: "Effects of conditioning hops on drop jump and sprint performance: a randomized crossover pilot study in elite athletes"
    body: "A force plate (Leonardo Mechanograph®, Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany; sampling frequency 800 Hz) was used to record vertical ground reaction force and to quantify DJ performance. Contact times (CTDJ), rebound flight times (FT), peak forces (Fmax), and mechanical external concentric peak power relative to the individual athletes’ body mass (Pmax) were then calculated (Leonardo Mechanography Research Edition® software, Novotec Medical, Pforzheim, Germany). The performance index (PI) was calculated by dividing FT by CTDJ. Rebound jump height (JH) was determined by the following formula: JH=\raisebox1ex$1$/\raisebox−1ex$8$⋅g⋅FT2JH=\raisebox1ex$1$/\raisebox−1ex$8$⋅g⋅FT2 (g = gravitational constant).An opto-electronic measurement system (OptoJump next®, MicroGate®, Bolzano, Italy) was used to quantify sprint performance over a distance of 30 m (spatial resolution: 0.01 m; sampling frequency: 1000 Hz). This system recorded the split sprint time over distances of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m (ST10, ST20, and ST30). In addition, step length (SL) as well as contact times (CTSprint) were measured during the first 10 meters of the sprint trials.The mean values of 8 DJs and 4 sprints from each condition were used to compare performance variables between HOP and CON. Due to the limited number of study participants, differences between CON and HOP regarding JH and sprint performance (ST10, ST20, ST30, SL, and CTSprint) were analysed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples.Additionally, dependent t-tests for paired samples were calculated to reveal intra-individual differences in the 8 drop jumps between CON and HOP. To do so, JH, CTDJ, Pmax, Fmax, and PI of the 8 jumps from both conditions were compared within each athlete. Group data are presented as mean values ± SD. Test-retest reliability was determined by means of a 2-way mixed model calculation for the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) on consistency [22] of each of the sprint and jump variables between the CON and HOP condition. Level of significance was set to p < 0.05. Results The Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples revealed a significant increase in mean jump height (11 %; p < 0.05) in the HOP (0.35 m) compared to the CON (0.31 m) condition (ICCJH: 0.98, p < 0.01). The mean JH over the 8 DJs increased for each single athlete in the HOP compared to the CON condition (see Fig. 1). However, when analyzing the JH of each athlete’s jumps in the two conditions with dependent t-tests for paired samples, these differences were significant in 3 out of 5 athletes (B, C, D; ICCPmax: 0.93, p < 0.05). The same 3 athletes reached a significantly higher Pmax during the 8 DJs in the HOP compared to the CON condition (see Fig. 1). One of the two remaining participants (E) showed a tendency for a higher Pmax value in the HOP compared to the CON condition (p = 0.051). Of note, athlete A showed a lower Pmax value in the HOP condition compared to CON. The same athlete exhibited a significant longer CTDJ in the HOP condition (13 %, p < 0.05), whereas athlete B had a shorter CTDJ (10 %, p < 0.05, see Table 1; ICCCT: 0.88, p < 0.05). The PI increased individually between 6-24 % and this difference was significant for athletes B, C and D (ICCPI: 0.89, p < 0.05). In contrast to Pmax, no significant differences were found for Fmax between the two experimental conditions in all analyzed participants (ICCFmax: 0.94; p < 0.01)."

    title: "Effects of Silicate, Phosphate, and Calcium on the Stability of Aldopentoses"
    body: "Abstract Ribose is an important constituent of RNA: ribose connects RNA bases and forms a strand of sugar phosphates. Accumulation of ribose on prebiotic Earth was difficult because of its low stability. Improvement in the yield of ribose by the introduction of borate or silicate in a formose-like reaction has been proposed. The effects of borates have been further analyzed and confirmed in subsequent studies. Nonetheless, the effects of silicates and phosphates remain unclear. In the present study, we incubated aldopentoses in a highly alkaline aqueous solution at a moderate temperature to determine the effects of silicate or phosphate on the degradation rates of ribose and its isomeric aldopentoses. The formation of a complex of silicate (or phosphate) with ribose was also analyzed in experiments with 29Si and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We found that silicate or phosphate complexes of ribose were not detectable under our experimental conditions. The stability of ribose and lyxose improved after addition of 40-fold molar excess (relative to a pentose) of sodium silicate or sodium phosphate to the alkaline solution. The stability was not improved further when an 80-fold molar excess of sodium silicate or sodium phosphate was added. Calcium was removed from these solutions by precipitation of calcium salts. The drop in Ca2+ concentration might have improved the stability of ribose and lyxose, which are susceptible to aldol addition. The improvement of ribose stability by the removal of Ca2+ and by addition of silicate or phosphate was far smaller than the improvement by borate. Furthermore, all aldopentoses showed similar stability in silicate- and phosphate-containing solutions. These results clearly show that selective stabilization of ribose by borate cannot be replaced by the effects of silicate or phosphate; this finding points to the importance of borate in prebiotic RNA formation. Keywords Ribose RNA Silicate Phosphate Borate Introduction Catalytic activities as well as the role of a genetic-code carrier have attracted many researchers to RNA as the first biomolecule to support both genetic functions and phenotype (Rich 1962; Crick 1968; Benner et al. 1989; Joyce 1989). In contrast to the attractive biochemical properties of RNA, its spontaneous formation under prebiotic conditions seems rather difficult. One of the problematic steps for the RNA formation is the accumulation of ribose under prebiotic conditions. The simplest source material that was proposed for the abiotic formation of ribose is formaldehyde, which could have been formed by photochemical reactions between carbon dioxide and water (Pinto et al. 1980; Cleaves 2008). Condensation of formaldehyde in alkaline solutions facilitated the synthesis of “formose” including ribose (Butlerow 1860; Breslow 1959; Shapiro 1988; Schwartz and Degraaf 1993). On the other hand, the yield of ribose in the formose process is very low due to the low stability of ribose (El Khadem et al. 1987; Larralde et al. 1995). Furthermore, the formose process itself consumes ribose in its successive condensation reactions (Mizuno and Weiss 1974). To overcome this problem, two stabilizers, mostly borates and silicates, have been proposed. Borate forms a stable complex with pentoses, in particular with ribose in its furanose form (Chapelle and Verchere 1988; Li et al. 2005; Amaral et al. 2008; Šponer et al. 2008; Pepi et al. 2010). The borate ion increases the stability of ribose (Prieur 2001; Scorei and Cimpoiasu 2006). The stability increase is most significant for ribose among other aldopentoses (Kim et al. 2011; Furukawa et al. 2013). The improved yield of ribose has been shown in simplified formose reactions involving borate (Ricardo et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2011). Formation of a complex between silicate and sugars (such as ribose) was demonstrated a decade ago (Lambert et al. 2004). The ribose-silicate complex is thermodynamically the most flavored form among pentose-silicate complexes (Vazquez-Mayagoitia et al. 2011). A silicate-guided formose reaction was proposed recently (Lambert et al. 2010), but this result was challenged by Kim and Benner (2010). To determine whether the silicate ion is an effective agent for stabilizing ribose (and more effective than borate), experiments that allow for direct comparison between the effects of borate and silicate are needed. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of silicate (or phosphate) on the stability of ribose and its isomeric aldopentoses. We also compared these results with the results of similar experiments with borate (Furukawa et al. 2013).The phosphate group is another constituent of the RNA backbone, alternately connecting ribose units. Thus, phosphate is a plausible stabilizer that is present in the environment during several steps of RNA formation. In this study, therefore, we also examined the effects of phosphate on the stability of ribose and its isomeric aldopentoses."

    title: "Alcohol as a Risk Factor for Cancer Burden: A Review"
    body: "Abstract Alcohol is eliminated from the body by various metabolic mechanisms. The primary enzymes in such mechanism involved are alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, cytochrome P450 2E1, and catalase. Variations in the genes for these enzymes have been found to influence alcohol consumption. The consequences of alcohol metabolism include oxygen deficits (i.e., hypoxia) in the liver, resulting in the formation of harmful compounds (i.e., adducts) and highly reactive oxygen-containing molecules (i.e., reactive oxygen species) that can damage cell components. Approximately, worldwide 3.6 % of cancers derive from chronic alcohol drinking, including those of the upper aerodigestive tract, the liver, the colorectum and the breast. Although the mechanisms for alcohol-associated carcinogenesis are not completely understood, recent findings have focused on acetaldehyde, the first and most toxic ethanol metabolite, as a cancer-causing agent. Alcohol-related carcinogenesis may aggravate due to other factors such as smoking and being triggered by genetic susceptibility. Besides, the role of genetic polymorphisms of the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes could not be ruled out.

Alcoholic beverage is consumed largely for physiological and psychological effects. Alcoholic beverages include wines, beers and spirits. In beers, the alcohol content varies from as little as 2 % to as much as 8 % (Baan and Straif 2007). Natural or unfortified wines such as burgundy, Chianti and chardonnay usually contain 8–12 % alcohol, though some varieties have somewhat higher content, ranging from 12 to 14 %. Spirits, including vodka, rum and whiskey, usually contain 40–50 % alcohol (Baan and Straif 2007). A standard drink served in most bars contains 0.5–0.7 fluid ounce of absolute alcohol. Thus, a 1.5 oz (45 ml) shot of vodka, a 5 oz (150 ml) glass of wine, and a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle of beer are equally intoxicating (Baan and Straif 2007). When an alcoholic beverage is swallowed, it is diluted by gastric juices in the stomach. A small portion of the alcohol is diffused into the bloodstream directly from the stomach wall, but most passes through the pyloric junction into the small intestine, where it is very rapidly absorbed. However, up to half of the alcohol is degraded in the stomach before it passes into the small intestine. The irritating effects of alcohol, especially in undiluted strong beverages, can result in damage to the tissues of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus and stomach and an increasing susceptibility to cancer in these organs (Baan and Straif 2007). The liver is likely to suffer serious damage if it copes for extended periods with the detoxification of large amounts of alcohol. There can also be damage to the heart muscle and the pancreas. Chronic alcohol consumption is a major health issue worldwide which may lead to addiction as well as damage of almost every organ of the body. The most comprehensive estimation of death rates induced by alcohol consumption could be revealed from the report of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Burden of Disease Project. In that report it is stated that alcohol accounts for approximately 1.8 million deaths per year [3.2 % of all deaths (Rehm et al. 2004)]. Worldwide, a total of approximately 389,000 cases of cancer, representing 3.6 % of all cancers (5.2 % in men and 1.7 % in women) are the effects of chronic alcohol consumption (Boffetta and Hashibe 2006). Alcohol combined with various demographic factors such as age, sex, and geographic region plays a role in cancer (Boffetta et al. 2006). Epidemiology One of the most significant diseases caused by chronic alcohol consumption is cancer. Many prospective and case control studies show a two-three fold increased risk for cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and oesophagus in people who consume 50 g of alcohol a day (equal to approximately a half bottle of wine), compared to non-drinkers (Baan and Straif 2007; Talamini et al. 2002; Boeing 2002). More than 100 epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in the risk of breast cancer with chronic alcohol consumption (Baan and Straif 2007). A meta-analysis of 38 epidemiological studies found that the risk of breast cancer for one, two, or three or more drinks per day increases by 10, 20 and 40 %, respectively (Longnecker 1994). Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide (Jemal et al. 2010). The relation between alcohol consumption and GC risk has been investigated in numerous epidemiologic studies with inconsistent results (Shibata and Parsonnet 2006; Kelley and Duggan 2003). In 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that the impact of alcohol intake in inducing GC is inconsistent while the World Cancer Research Fund opined that the available data are very limited for any conclusion (Baan and Straif 2007). In addition, five of six studies showed a significant correlation between colorectal polyps and alcohol consumption (Seitz et al. 2006; Homann et al. 1997). From these epidemiological data, it can be concluded that ethanol, independent of the type of alcoholic beverage, stimulates carcinogenesis. In addition, more than 50 studies were performed using various mouse and rat strains and various carcinogens to induce tumours to determine whether ethanol can modify chemically induced carcinogenesis. Depending on the carcinogen and the animal model used, mammary gland, oesophagus, stomach, large intestine, liver, kidney, lung, thymus and skin have been identified as tumour-specific target organs (Baan and Straif 2007)."
