  title: "Mechanical Stimulation-Induced Cross-Adaptation in Plants: An Overview"
  body: "Mechanical stimulation (MS), existing widely but ignored usually in nature, is one of the environmental stress factors. MS not only affects growth, development, morphogenesis, and even survival of plants, but also induces the formation of cross-adaptation. In cross-adaptation, plants make use of common pathways and components to adapt to a range of different stresses after exposure to one specific stress. Here, we summarize current knowledge of MS-induced cross-adaptation to chilling, heat, salt, drought, and pathogen stress, as well as its possible mechanisms. Plants, due to sessile nature, are constantly exposed to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Abiotic stresses, including extreme temperature, drought, high salinity, heavy metal, and mechanical stimulation (MS), are major causes of crop failure worldwide. MS, namely mechanical stress, such as wind, raining, hailing, touching, gravity, grazing, loading, and soil obstruction, existing widely but ignored usually in nature, is one of the abiotic factors affecting growth, development, morphogenesis, and even survival of plants (Jaffe and Biro 1979; Knight 2000; Braam 2005; Fig. 1). Plants have developed sensory mechanisms to detect mechanical stimulation and to induce a suite of responses such as anatomical, physiological, biochemical, biophysical, and molecular collectively termed “thigmomorphogenesis” (Jaffe and Biro 1979; Knight 2000; Braam 2005). The study on MS may have been traced back to The Power of Movement in Plants by Charles Darwin (1880), but advances in MS is very slow due to its diversity, complexity, uncertainty, and it is hard to quantify. With the development of molecular biology technique and imaging technique, understanding MS has made great progresses in recent years. https://static-content.springer.com/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs12374-011-9178-3/MediaObjects/12374_2011_9178_Fig1_HTML.gif Fig. 1 Types of mechanical stimulation in plants. Plants subject simultaneously and sequentially to various overground and underground mechanical stimulations in nature (adapted in part from Buchanan et al. 2000) For excellent additional information, we refer readers to wonderful reviews written more recently (Braam 2005; Chehab et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010). Here, we summarize current knowledge of MS-induced cross-adaptation to chilling, heat, salt, drought, and pathogen stress, as well as its possible mechanisms. MS-Induced Cross-Adaptation Cross-adaptation, namely cross-tolerance, is the phenomenon by which a plant resistance to a stress leads to resistance to another form of stress. For example, cold acclimation can increase heat tolerance of winter rye, ultraviolet radiation can enhance heat tolerance in cucumber and cold hardiness in Rhododendron, and salt pretreatment can induce cold hardiness rapidly in spinach and potato (Knight 2000). Our previous experiments results showed that heat shock can improve resistance of maize seedlings to heat, chilling, salt, and drought (Gong et al. 2001). We and other authors have found that mechanical stress can induce cross-adaptation in plants as summarized as follows (Table 1)."
